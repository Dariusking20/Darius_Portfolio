# [Project 2: Time Series Analysis and Forcasting of Airlines of the 2020 Pandemic.](https://github.com/Dariusking20/Time_series_and_Forecasting_Analysis/blob/main/Time_series_and_forecasting_analysis.ipynb)
* Produced a time plot of the time series <i>prior to the collapse of the industry due to the pandemic in 2020.
* Created differenced time series for various lags and an appropriate seasonal differenced series for the data.
* Fit a suitable ARIMA model to the transformed data using either the pmdarima package's auto_arima method and a grid search plus the statsmodels SARIAX method.
* Use the AIC to choose the best SARIMA model for your data, then check the residual diagnostics.
* Plotted the best-fit Exponential Smoothing model predicted values and forecast values along with the entire original air passenger dataset.
